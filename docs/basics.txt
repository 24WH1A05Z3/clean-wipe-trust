Secure Data Erasure Prototype: Project Outline

Objective
Develop a comprehensive, cross-platform secure data erasure desktop application that can automatically detect, classify, and securely wipe a wide range of storage devices including traditional HDDs, SSDs (including NVMe), USB storage, and Android mobile devices. The application aims to:

    - Deliver industrial-grade, standards-compliant data erasure using both software overwrites and hardware-level secure erase commands.

    - Provide cryptographic erasure support to instantly render encrypted data irrecoverable.

    - Support real-time device monitoring and detection across Linux and Windows.

    - Automate device classification and choose the best erasure method without manual intervention.

    - Maintain detailed, tamper-evident audit logs documenting every erasure action and its result for regulatory compliance.

    - Generate formal, digitally verifiable erasure certificates for each sanitized device to aid in IT asset disposition (ITAD), audit readiness, and chain-of-custody assurance.

    - Offer a user-friendly GUI and CLI interface based on Electron and Node.js for easy adoption in enterprise and technical environments.

    - Prioritize security, reliability, and extensibility to accommodate future device types and erasure standards.

    - Optimize performance to handle device-specific wipe challenges including wear-leveling on SSDs and flash storage idiosyncrasies on mobile devices.

    - Support safe, repeatable data sanitization cycles and error handling to ensure maximal data protection.


Platform Support

- Linux
- Windows


Core Requirements

- Detect all connected storage devices (HDD, SSD, USB, Android)
- Classify device type and status (HDD/SSD/Android/encrypted)
- Apply secure and device-specific erasure methods
- Maintain detailed audit logs of all actions
- Automatically generate official erasure certificates


Device Detection Approach

Linux

- Use libudev for real-time device add/remove event tracking
- Use lsblk to enumerate block device details (NAME, ROTA, TYPE, SIZE)
- Detect device type (ROTA=1 → HDD, ROTA=0 → SSD) and USB status

Windows

- Use WMI via PowerShell or Python scripts for device enumeration
- Identify drives by model, interface type, serial, and USB presence

Android

- Use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) for device listing and communication
- Detect connected devices by scanning via adb devices
- Check USB vendor/product IDs on Linux or device class via Windows WMI



Erasure Methods

Linux

- HDD: Overwrite full disk multiple times with shred utility
- SSD NVMe: Use nvme-cli firmware secure erase or crypto erase commands
- Encrypted Volumes: Use VeraCrypt to strip encryption keys for cryptographic erasure

Windows

- HDD: Eraser tool multi-pass overwrites
- SSD: Vendor-specific secure erase utilities (Samsung Magician, Intel Toolbox)
- NVMe SSD: Vendor NVMe utilities for hardware erase
- Encrypted Volumes: VeraCrypt key deletion cryptographic erasure

Android

- Enable full device encryption before wipe
- Perform factory reset/master clear via ADB:
  adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR
- Use root-enabled open-source apps (e.g., Extirpater) for overwriting free space
- Recommend physical destruction for highest assurance

Detailed Workflow

1. Device Detection

- Monitor system USB events (libudev on Linux, WMI on Windows)
- Detect new device connections/removals in near real-time
- Invoke device enumeration commands (lsblk, WMI queries, adb devices)
- Identify device type and detect if encrypted or mobile

2. Classification & Verification

- Confirm device accessible for erasure (permissions, mount status)
- Classify by device type, connection interface, encryption state
- Log device metadata (serial, model, size, device path)

3. Erasure Method Selection

- Automated choice based on device type and encryption:
  - HDD → multi-pass overwrite tools
  - SSD NVMe → hardware secure erase commands
  - Encrypted → cryptographic key destruction
  - Android → factory reset via ADB + encryption enforced

4. Execution & Monitoring

- Execute erasure commands, monitor system process outputs
- Verify erasure success through tool return codes/log parsing
- Repeat or escalate procedures on failure or partial erase

5. Audit Log Maintenance

- Append detailed logs with timestamps, user identity, device info, method, results
- Use structured logs (JSON/CSV/DB) with error and system state capture
- Secure and periodically archive logs for tamper-proof audit trail

6. Certification Generation

- Auto-generate digital certificates containing:
  - Unique certificate ID
  - Device identifiers and specs
  - Erasure method and command logs
  - Operator details and timestamps
  - Digital or cryptographic signature for authenticity
- Export as PDF or HTML and integrate with log storage

Technical Explanation

- libudev & lsblk: Real-time Linux device event listener + device property enumeration
- WMI: Windows Management Instrumentation querying hardware info
- shred & Eraser: Software-based disk sector overwrite for HDDs with multiple passes
- nvme-cli: NVMe protocol command-line tool enabling drive firmware secure erase/crypto erase
- Vendor SSD Tools: Manufacturer utilities employing firmware-level hardware wipes
- VeraCrypt: Cryptographic erasure by deleting encryption keys, making encrypted data unreadable instantly
- ADB: Android Debug Bridge open-source tool for device enumeration and command execution (factory reset)
- Extirpater: Advanced root-level free space overwriter for Android devices

---

Limitations

- Wear leveling on SSDs and Android flash can leave residual data in hidden blocks
- Software overwrites on SSDs may be ineffective without firmware erase support
- Complete removal of data from Android flash (eMMC/UFS) is limited by hardware design
- Root access needed for in-depth Android free space wiping tools
- Physical destruction is recommended for highest security requirements
- Vendor tools may be Windows-only and proprietary, limiting cross-platform open-source coverage
- Erasure speed depends heavily on device size and interface speed

Suggested Tech Stack

- Frontend: Electron for cross-platform desktop GUI
- Backend: Node.js for orchestration and scripting
- Native Integration:
  - Node bindings for libudev on Linux
  - Child process spawning for lsblk, shred, nvme-cli (Linux)
  - WMI calls and PowerShell spawning (Windows)
  - ADB command-line execution for Android detection and wipe
- Logging: Use JSON or SQLite for structured logs
- Certificate Generation: PDF generation libraries (e.g., pdfkit, jsPDF) with optional cryptographic signing
- Testing: Wide device test coverage on Linux/Windows and various device types
