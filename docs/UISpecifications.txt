The design emphasizes trust, security, simplicity, and professional aesthetics while maintaining compliance with industry standards.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Trust & Security**: Visual elements that convey security and reliability through professional color schemes and iconography
- **Simplicity First**: One-click operation for general public use with intuitive navigation
- **Professional Aesthetics**: Clean, modern interface suitable for enterprise environments
- **Subtle Animation**: Purposeful animations that enhance UX without being distracting
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant design with proper contrast ratios
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Native feel on Windows, Linux, and Android


## Application Structure

### Main Window Layout
The application features a single-window design with a custom title bar containing the SecureWipe Pro logo on the left and standard window controls on the right. Below the title bar is a horizontal tab navigation with four main sections: Device Detection, Erase Process, Certificates, and Logs. The main content area adapts based on the selected tab, while a status bar at the bottom shows real-time system information including device count and last action timestamp.

### Window Behavior
The application window has a minimum size of 1200x800 pixels with a default size of 1400x900 pixels. The window is resizable but maintains minimum constraints to ensure UI elements remain readable. The application automatically detects system dark mode preferences and adjusts the color scheme accordingly.

## Tab 1: Device Detection & Selection

### Primary Content Area
The device detection screen features a clean, card-based layout for displaying connected storage devices. At the top is a "Device Detection" header with a search icon, followed by an auto-refreshing device list container. Each detected device appears as a distinct card with rounded corners and subtle shadows.

### Device Cards
Each device card displays an appropriate icon based on device type (SSD, HDD, mobile, USB). The device name and capacity are prominently displayed at the top, followed by key technical details including device type, ready status, serial number, and encryption state. Each card includes a "Select for Wipe" button with a trash can icon that becomes prominent on hover.

### Device Information Display
Device cards show essential information in a structured format: device model and capacity as the primary heading, device type and status as secondary information, and technical details like serial numbers and encryption status as tertiary information. Status indicators use color coding - green for ready devices, blue for active operations, gray for inaccessible devices, and red for error states.

### Settings Panel
Below the device list is a settings panel with erasure configuration options. This includes checkboxes for standards compliance (NIST SP 800-88, DoD 5220.22-M, BSI-GS), radio buttons for verification methods (digital certificate or third-party verification), and additional options for specialized erasure requirements.

### Primary Action Button
A prominent "Start Secure Wipe" button appears at the bottom center of the screen, styled with the primary blue color and a rocket icon. The button is disabled until at least one device is selected and becomes visually emphasized when conditions are met.

## Tab 2: Erase Process

### Process Overview
The erase process screen displays real-time progress for ongoing erasure operations. The layout features a large progress visualization at the top, followed by detailed logs and status information for each device being processed.

### Progress Visualization
A circular progress indicator shows overall completion percentage, surrounded by device-specific progress bars for multi-device operations. Each progress element includes estimated time remaining, current operation phase, and data throughput information.

### Process Details
Below the progress visualization is a scrollable log area showing real-time command outputs, timestamps, and operation details. Each log entry is color-coded based on severity (info, warning, error) and includes expandable sections for technical details.

### Control Elements
The process screen includes pause, resume, and cancel buttons for operation control. These buttons are contextually enabled based on current operation state and include confirmation dialogs for potentially destructive actions.

## Tab 3: Certificates

### Certificate Management
The certificates tab displays a gallery view of generated wipe certificates, organized chronologically with search and filter capabilities. Each certificate appears as a preview card showing device information, wipe completion date, and certificate status.

### Certificate Details
Clicking a certificate opens a detailed view showing the complete wipe report, including device specifications, erasure methods used, verification results, and digital signature information. The detail view includes options to export as PDF, verify certificate integrity, and share for third-party verification.

### Export Options
Certificate export functionality provides multiple format options including PDF for formal documentation, JSON for programmatic verification, and QR codes for mobile verification workflows.

## Tab 4: Logs & Audit Trail

### Log Visualization
The logs section features a table-based view of all application activities with sortable columns for timestamp, device, action, user, and result. Advanced filtering options allow users to narrow logs by date range, device type, or operation result.

### Log Details
Each log entry can be expanded to show complete technical details including command execution logs, system state information, and error diagnostics. Logs are structured as JSON internally but presented in human-readable format in the interface.

### Audit Features
The audit trail includes integrity verification indicators, export capabilities for compliance reporting, and search functionality for forensic analysis.

## Animation & Interaction Design

### Micro-Animations
The application uses subtle animations to enhance user experience including smooth transitions between tabs (300ms ease-out), gentle fade-ins for new content (200ms), and satisfying button interactions with scale transforms (150ms). Progress bars animate smoothly to show real-time updates, and status changes include brief highlight animations to draw attention.

### Loading States
All data loading operations display appropriate loading indicators including skeleton screens for device detection, spinner overlays for quick operations, and progress bars for long-running tasks.

### Feedback Mechanisms
User actions receive immediate visual feedback through button state changes, form validation indicators, and success/error notifications using toast messages that appear from the top-right corner.

## Responsive Design

### Layout Adaptation
The interface adapts to different window sizes by reflowing content, collapsing navigation elements when necessary, and adjusting card layouts for optimal space utilization while maintaining readability at all supported sizes.

### Content Prioritization
On smaller screens, less critical information is hidden or moved to expandable sections, ensuring core functionality remains accessible while maintaining professional appearance.

## Accessibility Considerations

### Keyboard Navigation
All interface elements are keyboard accessible with logical tab order, visible focus indicators, and keyboard shortcuts for common actions. Screen reader compatibility is ensured through proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels.

### Visual Accessibility
The color scheme maintains WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios, important information is conveyed through multiple visual cues (not just color), and font sizes are optimized for readability across different screen densities.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Electron Integration
The UI leverages Electron's native capabilities for file system access, system notifications, and platform-specific styling while maintaining cross-platform consistency through careful CSS design.

### Performance Optimization
The interface uses virtual scrolling for large device lists, debounced search inputs to prevent excessive API calls, and efficient rendering patterns to maintain smooth animations even during intensive background operations.

### State Management
Application state is managed through a centralized store with reactive updates to UI components, ensuring consistent data presentation across all interface sections and real-time synchronization of device status and operation progress.
